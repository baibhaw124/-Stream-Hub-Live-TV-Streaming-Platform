# 📺 StreamHub – Live TV Streaming Platform

StreamHub is a frontend-based live TV and streaming web application inspired by popular OTT platforms such as JioTV. The project allows users to browse and watch live TV channels, movies, and shows through a modern, interactive, and responsive user interface.

The application is developed using core web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features dynamic channel rendering, real-time search functionality, category-based filtering, and a modal-based video player. StreamHub supports adaptive streaming formats such as HLS (.m3u8) and DASH (.mpd) using HLS.js and DASH.js, ensuring smooth playback across different network conditions.

The UI follows a dark-themed OTT-style design with animations, responsive layouts, and a playlist sidebar for easy channel navigation. A lightweight React setup is used for project structuring and redirection, while the main streaming logic is handled through vanilla JavaScript.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of frontend development, streaming technologies, and modern UI/UX design principles.
